          Have you ever tried to take a picture of your math homework or a receipt and your iPhone scans the paper as a pdf instead of a regular image? Well, that is actually a really interesting application of Computer Vision and Python, which is the tool we will be building today. Due to the rising online workload, sending a digitalized version of a document by email or other means is becoming increasingly common. To put it another way, turn any paper into a scan-like presentation.

          When it comes to stocks, a backtester is an essential tool. Backtesting is a method of determining the practicality of a trading strategy by examining how it would perform using previous data. If you came up with a strategy, would you automatically trust it? No, you would want to test it, and historical data helps that. If backtesting proves to be effective, traders and analysts may be more willing to use it in the future. Essentially, backtesting takes historical data and applies it to current data to predict how stocks would perform. The main issue with backtesting is that it is a lot of work and takes a long to do manually, so that is why it would be smart to build one with Python. The strategy we will use is the moving averages strategy and implement that into our code.

          In my previous article on Decision Trees, I covered everything about Decision Trees and how to build one with Python. The Random Forest Algorithm is a successor to Decision Trees as it is composed of many trees. In this article, I explain not only how a Random Forest works but also how to build one.

          Linear algebra is extremely important in the topic of computer science and especially machine learning. Linear regression is a simple supervised machine learning model directly built off linear algebra. The goal of this article is not to give you a math lesson but instead walk you through the algebra that makes up a regression model and then how to build one in python.
